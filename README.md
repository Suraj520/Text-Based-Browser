# Project: Text-Based Browser
### About
Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal. So, let's use Python to create a text-based browser! Of course, making a real, full-blown browser is a very difficult task. In this project, you'll create a very simple browser that will ignore JavaScript and CSS, won't have cookies, and will only process a limited set of tags. Still, it will be useful and, most importantly, fun to program!
### Learning outcomes
You will learn how HTTP works and how to handle its protocols using Python. You will also learn all about Python input/output, as well as parsing HTML.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals
Python Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/6: Address line
Let's create the first capability for our browser! It has to read the URL and show the user a "hard-coded" website with some news.
### Stage 2/6: Tabs
Time to add some user-friendliness. The program should store our pages as files and show them if the user enters a shortened request. Watch for inappropriate input, though!
### Stage 3/6: Hotkeys
Sometimes you want to revisit the past. Let's add a “back” button by using the stack.
### Stage 4/6: Requesting
Time to play in a new way. Now only real web pages! Get to know the Request library.
### Stage 5/6: Parsing
Let’s enhance the readability of our pages and teach our browser to output only a certain text from HTML tags.
### Stage 6/6: Formatted output
Look-and-feel is important to the browser experience. Let's read about a new library, experiment a bit, and highlight our links in blue.
